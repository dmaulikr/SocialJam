# SocialJam
Goal: Making a networked mobile strategy game in 24 hours.

We're not going to be going through the hassle of setting up Git LFS for this game jam, so we're ignoring everyhing in *Assets/Resources* by default.

Upload any resources (audio, SFX, textures, etc.) to the Google Drive folder as a .unitypackage instead. (Please *include a timestamp*.)

Please don't try to track large assets using source control; it makes cloning / merging problematic.
